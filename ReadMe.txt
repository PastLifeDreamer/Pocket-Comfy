What it does:
Pocket Comfy unifies the best web apps currently available for content creation including: ComfyUI, ComfyUI Mini (Created by ImDarkTom), and smart-comfyui-gallery (Created by biagiomaf) into one web app that runs from a single Python window. Launch, monitor, and manage everything from one place at home or on the go. (Tailscale VPN recommended for use outside of your network)
